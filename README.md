# Converter-DH-to-Ryal


This is a simple PHP-based currency converter project that allows users to convert between **Moroccan Dirham (DH)** and the old **Moroccan Ryal**. It also features a modern UI with gradient colors and a patriotic Moroccan theme, including the national flag and a motivational quote.

📝 Why This Project?
In Morocco, the official currency is the Dirham (DH). However, in daily life, especially in traditional markets and with older generations, many people still refer to prices using the Ryal — even though it's no longer the official unit. This can be confusing, especially for young people or tourists who may not be familiar with the conversion. Since 1 Dirham equals 20 Ryals, this simple tool helps make everyday money conversations and shopping easier for everyone. I created this project to simplify the conversion and help Moroccan users better understand prices expressed in both currencies.
